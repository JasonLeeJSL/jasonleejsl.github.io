Bio
=====

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Deep Learning in Theory and Practice Lab](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/kawaguchi). Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) \(*the Highest Honors Degree*\) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

At present, I am focusing on Physics-informed Neural Networks, Deep Learning Theory and Reinforcement Learning Theory.

For more info about me, here is my [CV](http://jasonleejsl.github.io/files/CV_Jingshu_Li.pdf).
