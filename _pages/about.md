Bio
=====

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Yi-Chieh Lee](https://www.yclee.net/), and I also collaborate with [Prof. Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/kawaguchi) on topics about AI for science. Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with *the Highest Honors Degree* and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

At present, I am focusing on Social Computing (AI for social computing), Physics-informed Neural Networks (AI for science), Neoral Operators and Deep Learning Theory.

For more info about me, here is my [CV](http://jasonleejsl.github.io/files/CV_Jingshu_Li.pdf).
