Bio
=====

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [AI4SG Lab](https://www.ai4sg.org/about), in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Yi-Chieh Lee](https://www.yclee.net/). I am also honored to collaborate with [Prof. Renwen Zhang](https://renwenzhang.com/), [Prof. Vera Q. Liao](https://qveraliao.com/), and [Dr. Zicheng Zhu](https://www.zicheng-zhu.com/). I have passed my QE with committee: [Prof. Chua Tat-Sengâ€‹](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Brian Y. Lim](https://www.brianlim.net/). Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with *the Highest Honors Degree* and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

At present, I am focusing on topics about human-AI decision making, behavioral contagion, and altering users' cognitive process (especially metacognition) and behavior via AI agents. I'm also working on promoting prosociality in HCI.
