Bio
=====

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Yi-Chieh Lee](https://www.yclee.net/). Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with *the Highest Honors Degree* and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

At present, I am focusing on Social Computing, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Trustworthy AI.
