# Background & Motivation
With the rapid development of AI, it is inevitable that AI will play a significant role in the foreseeable future of human society. The core vision of this project goes beyond improving efficiency or usability‚Äîit aims to shape a harmonious human‚ÄìAI society. A promising direction is to design systems that foster **empathy** and **prosocial behavior**.  

As chatbots are increasingly integrated into everyday life‚Äîas companions, assistants, or collaborators‚Äîan important question arises: **Can chatbots be designed not only to help humans, but also to evoke human empathy and kindness, thereby fostering more cooperative and compassionate human‚ÄìAI relationships?**  

Our research addresses this question through two important directions:  
1. **Exploring how anthropomorphic chatbots elicit human empathy and prosocial behavior toward machines.**  
2. **Investigating whether such empathy and prosociality can transfer to the groups represented by chatbots.**  

Together, these two lines of research demonstrate that prosociality can function not only as a psychological mechanism in technology design but also as a value orientation that guides HCI toward more empathetic, ethical, and sustainable futures.

# Study 1: Anthropomorphic Chatbots and Human Prosocial Behavior
In the first study (published in the *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, CSCW 2025*), we focused on **‚Äúreverse helping‚Äù**: not how chatbots assist humans, but whether humans are willing to help chatbots. Drawing on the **Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) framework**, we conducted an online experiment with 244 participants, manipulating three anthropomorphic features‚Äî**human-like identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression (emojis)**.  

Results showed that these design elements significantly enhanced participants‚Äô **cognitive and affective empathy** toward the chatbot, which in turn encouraged **instrumental support** (e.g., correcting errors) and **emotional support** (e.g., comforting the chatbot). Qualitative analysis further revealed that participants‚Äô motivations stemmed mainly from two sources: empathizing with the chatbot‚Äôs situation and perceiving it as ‚Äúhuman-like.‚Äù  

This study illustrates how anthropomorphic design can transform human‚Äìchatbot interaction into a **mutually supportive relationship**, offering new insights for future human‚ÄìAI collaboration.

# Study 2: Animal-Persona Chatbots for Empathy and Prosociality toward Non-Human Beings
In the second study (published in the *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*), we turned to the question of how chatbots can help humans **expand empathy and prosociality beyond human‚ÄìAI boundaries**. We designed **animal-persona chatbots** (e.g., a horse) that communicated in the first person about their experiences. Using a 2√ó2√ó2 factorial experiment (N = 240), we examined the roles of **emotional expression (present/absent), non-verbal expression (emojis/no emojis), and identity cues (animal/robot)**.  

Findings revealed that animal-persona chatbots significantly increased humans‚Äô **empathy, positive attitudes, and prosocial intentions** toward animals, especially when authentic emotional expressions were conveyed. Interestingly, non-verbal cues (emojis) sometimes reduced empathy, highlighting the nuanced effects of design features.  

This study extends HCI research to **non-human digital personas**, demonstrating how technology can serve as a **bridge for interspecies understanding and ethical awareness**.

# Contributions & Future Directions
Taken together, these two studies show how HCI can leverage prosocial design to build a **harmonious human‚ÄìAI society**:  

- **Theoretical Contribution**: We reveal that empathy can be directed not only toward chatbots themselves but also extended through them to broader entities (e.g., animals).  
- **Design Contribution**: We identify key design levers‚Äîidentity cues, emotional expression, and non-verbal elements‚Äîthat can be strategically employed to elicit empathy and prosocial behavior.  
- **Societal Contribution**: By demonstrating that digital agents can nurture kindness and care, we highlight the potential of HCI in **education, environmental conservation, healthcare, and collaboration**.  

## Future Directions
- **Human‚ÄìAI Collaboration**: Designing chatbots that elicit prosociality can foster more cooperative and resilient human‚ÄìAI partnerships.  
- **Ethical & Social Value**: Animal-persona chatbots suggest that HCI can serve broader societal goals, such as reducing animal cruelty and enhancing ecological responsibility.  
- **Toward a Harmonious Human‚ÄìAI Society**: Ultimately, these studies suggest that when prosociality is embedded in design, HCI can not only improve interaction experiences but also actively cultivate **empathy, cooperation, and harmony**, driving the co-evolution of technology and society.  

This project envisions a future of a harmonious human‚ÄìAI society, built not only on efficiency and productivity but also on empathy, care, and cooperation‚Äîvalues traditionally reserved for human society, now extended to the broader non-human world.
