title: "Building a Harmonious Human-AI Society through Prosociality"
excerpt: "Using human-computer interaction design to elicit empathy and prosocial behaviors toward non-human entities‚Äîfirst with chatbots, then extending to animal personas‚Äîthis project demonstrates how prosociality can guide the creation of a more cooperative and harmonious human-machine society."

## Background and Motivation  
As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life, people now interact with chatbots, voice assistants, and other intelligent agents in ways that resemble social encounters. Traditionally, HCI research has focused on how machines can serve humans. Yet interactions are not a one-way street‚Äîpeople also show care, support, and kindness toward non-human entities.  

This project asks: **Can prosociality‚Äîthe tendency to help, comfort, and cooperate‚Äîextend beyond humans to machines and even to animals?** And if so, how might prosociality serve as a foundation for more **harmonious human-AI societies**?  

Prosocial behavior is a cornerstone of human communities, promoting trust, cooperation, and collective well-being. By examining how design elicits empathy and prosociality toward non-human entities, this project explores new ways in which HCI can contribute not only to effective collaboration, but also to broader social and ecological good.

## Study 1: Prosocial Behaviors Toward Chatbots (*CSCW 2025*)  
Our first study, published in the *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (CSCW 2025)*, investigated how chatbot design influences people‚Äôs willingness to help chatbots when they make mistakes.  

Through an online experiment with 244 participants, we manipulated chatbot **identity** (human-like vs. machine-like), **emotional expression**, and **non-verbal cues** (emojis). Results showed that:  

- **Anthropomorphism matters**: human-like identity and emotional expression elicited more empathy and prosocial support.  
- **Empathy is the key mechanism**: empathy bridged design features and prosocial behaviors.  
- **Emojis had a direct effect**: even without raising empathy, emojis encouraged comforting behaviors.  

These findings uncover the psychological mechanisms behind ‚Äúhelping machines‚Äù and suggest design strategies for building chatbots that foster **cooperation, trust, and resilience** in human-AI collaboration.

## Study 2: Extending Empathy to Animals via Chatbots (*IJHCS*)  
Building on these findings, our second study (accepted in the *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*) applied empathy-driven design to **animal-persona chatbots**.  

By equipping animal persona in chatbot interactions, we found that users developed stronger empathy and more positive attitudes toward animals. This demonstrates how HCI design can serve as a **mediator between humans and the non-human world**, fostering prosociality beyond human-AI boundaries.  

The study highlights how chatbots can be powerful tools for **conservation, environmental education, and public engagement**, showing that empathy mechanisms discovered in human-AI interaction can be applied to pressing social and ecological challenges.

## Future Impact and Vision  
Together, these two studies form the foundation of a broader research agenda: **using prosociality as a design principle for technology**.  

Looking forward, this project aims to:  
- **Advance human-AI collaboration**: designing systems that strengthen resilience, trust, and cooperation.  
- **Promote social and ecological good**: leveraging chatbots to extend empathy toward animals and other causes that matter to society.  
- **Guide ethical design practices**: balancing the benefits of prosocial design with careful reflection on the risks of emotional over-manipulation.  

Ultimately, this work envisions a future where **harmonious human-AI societies** are built not only on efficiency and productivity, but also on empathy, care, and cooperation‚Äîvalues traditionally reserved for human communities, now extended to the wider world of non-human entities.
